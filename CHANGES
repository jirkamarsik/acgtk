* Version 1.0b
** The acgc.opt/acgc compiler:
+ Now outputs an "file.acgo" file when compilation is successful
+ Can declare a lexicon as the composition of two other lexicons
  using the following declaration:
  lexicon lex_name = lex_name2 << lex_name1

** The acg.opt/acg interpreter:
+ Can load an acg object file using the command:

  load o file.acco;

+ The "analyse" command is deprecated. It is replaced by:
  + A "check" command, prefixed by signatures, that typecheck the
    typing assignment of a term

    Sig1 Sig2 check term:type;

  + A "realize" command that must be preceded by lexicons and followed
    by the type assignment of a term. It checks that the term is well
    typed in the abstract signatures of the lexicons and compute its
    realizations through the lexicons.

    Lex1 Lex2 realize term:type;

+ A "parse" command has been added. It must be preceded with the name
  of a lexicon and it returns the antecedent by this lexicon of the input
  term with respect to some distinguished (atomic) type:

  Lex parse object_term:distinguished_type;

+ A "query" command has been added. It follows the "parse" command
  syntax and it outputs the associated query and associated extensional
  database.

  Lex query object_term:distinguished_type;

+ A "idb" command has been added. It must be preceded with the name of
  a lexicon and it returns the intensional database associated with
  the lexicon

  Lex idb;
  

** Current limitation:
+ Only parse images of atomic types
+ The result of parsing with non-linear lexicons is unspecified yet
