This distribution provides two executables (possibly with the .opt
extension, see the INSTALL file):

	acgc
and
	acg


************
*** acgc ***
************

acgc is a "compiler" of ACG source code, i.e. files containing
definitions of signarures and lexicons. It basically checks whether
they are correctly written (syntactically and wrt types and constant
typing). An interactive mode is available to parse terms according to
signatures.

Run

	./acgc -help

to get help

***********
*** acg ***
***********

acg is an interpreter of command meant to be useful when using
ACGs. To get a list of command, run

	./acg

then on the prompt type

	help;




Example files are given in the ./examples directory. Read the
./examples/README file
