# We first show that the term "LOVE MARY JOHN"
# that is build in the "syntax" signature
# is indeed of type s
syntax analyse LOVE MARY JOHN :s ;

# And, for instance, that it is not of type np
syntax analyse LOVE MARY JOHN :np ;

# How is that term realized as a string?
# Just ask:
syntactic_realisation analyse LOVE MARY JOHN:s;

# And how is it realised semantically?
semantics  analyse LOVE MARY JOHN:s;

# Now let's check the relalisation and the meaning of
# (EVERY MAN) (lambda x. (SOME WOMAN) (lambda y. LOVE y x)) 
# which of course is of type s;
syntactic_realisation semantics analyse (EVERY MAN) (lambda x. (SOME WOMAN) (lambda y. LOVE y x)) :s;

# And the one of
# (SOME WOMAN) (lambda y. (EVERY MAN) (lambda x. LOVE y x))
# which is also of type s;
syntactic_realisation semantics analyse (SOME WOMAN) (lambda y. (EVERY MAN) (lambda x. LOVE y x)) :s;

# Indeed, these two different syntactic terms have a same syntactic realisation
# and two different meanings
