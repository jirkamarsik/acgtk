To install the ACG toolkit, first run:

	./configure

Then run:

	make

It should compile all the source under ./src/ and produce some of the
executables. Then you can run for instance:

	src/lambda/test

or
	src/acg-data/test

or

	src/acg-data/test --help

to have some help,
or

	src/scripting/test
